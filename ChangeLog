      (patch by Tomasz Konojacki)

      parameter (reported by NetBSD maintainer)
    ! silly bug where channels that were not bound are displayed
      in current window
    ! some numerics were not timestamped reported by Tim)
    ! mIRC colours brown and orange were mixed (reported by Tim's gf kut)
    ~ IGNORE QUIT now works per channel (hi Jugernaut!)
    ! hopefully scrolling through lastlog is now fixed for good

      (such as .CS or .YU), if you really miss them let me know and I
      can readd them
    + support for 256 colors if the terminal supports it - you can
      use FGx and BGx syntax in ScrollZ.save, for example, juha would

    + SZsetup can be used to configure for 256 colors - use keys
      'FfBb' to increase/decrease foreground/background, which works
      only when string FG or BG is found in color definiton and 'Ee'
      to insert the color string directly, but there is no real

      some context when shifting input prompt (patch by jm_)

      /DCC SEND nick <tab> cycles through files on disk - if you use a
      relative path it looks in your CDCC ULDIR or current dir if that
      isn't set, also completes commands as in /M<tab> and /HELP M<tab>,
      path in /LOAD and DCC CHAT nicks (coded by braneded, many thanks!)
    + SHOWWALLOP to toggle whether to show included/excluded nicks with
      channel wallops
    ! don't core in completion routine if we're not on a server
    + SSL support: to enable it call configure with --with-ssl. to use it
      SERVER -SSL HOST:PORT or WINDOW [-]SSL HOST:PORT or prefix server
      hostname with a ! as in scrollz nick !server:port. SSL connections are
      indicated with a ! in the server list (thanks to Sharky and Darkie for
      permission to use their code from BitchX SSL port)
    ~ PASSWD, it now acts as a master password a-la Mozilla for
      ENCRMSG and log files encryption - because of this you can't decode
      pre ScrollZ 1.9 encrypted files! it can now be used in interactive
      mode for privacy reasons
    ~ changed interface to ENCRMSG, it is now possible to use it entirely in
      interactive mode for privacy reasons, see help for new usage
      (requested by ogre)
    ! core dump on page up on very long lines (thanks to braneded)
    ! core dump on long lines when logging was enabled
    + time stamping to wallops (coded by braneded)
    + merged CAST encrypt stuff from ircII to ensure compatibility
      (you need to obtain cast_sbox.h and cast.c, run configure --with-cast,
      requested by Anton)
    + -COUNT option to FTRACE to only count matches and not report them
      (requested by ogre)
    ! WHOLEFT formatting which broke with SET STAMP_FORMAT when STAMP was
      set to MAX (reported by jm_)
    ~ upon netsplit we don't display 'Press Control-F to see who split away'
      notice anymore to save screen space
    + per channel logging, check help for commands CHANLOG, CHANLOGDIR,
      CHANLOGPOST and CHANLOGPREFIX (requested by Ahnberg and his gang)
    ! PONG notice being displayed on servers without dot in the server name
      (reported by Ahnberg)

      command (requested by Tero)
    ! ignore case of nickname in IGNORE nickname (reported by braneded)
    ~ display channel mode +-I when mode compression is enabled
      (reported by ogre)
    + mIRC compatible DCC resume, it has to be enabled in defs.h
      (patch submitted by braneded)
    ~ DCC speed calculation for resend/reget (fixed by braneded)
    ~ merged ircii-20011210 changes (without ISO-2022-JP stuff and mIRC
      color stuff - sorry but my screen.c is too different these days
      from ircII and ircII won't allow for ANSI color codes, also removed
      ircII's SET SHOW_STARS and SET STAR_PREFIX in favour of my, more
      complete code, there is no support for %v (voice status) in status
      bar as ScrollZ already uses %@ for that)
    + ARINWIN BOTH to always display public in window with level USERLOG4
      (even when public's channel is current channel, requested by fox)

    + support for uppercase usermodes (requested by a few users)
    ~ WINDOW SERVER server CHANNEL #chan,key now works (reported by
      qoreQyaS)
    ~ we now use HELP like ircII - all ScrollZ.help text was moved into
      help directory which is now part of the distribution (thanks braneded)
      plus I have also described all ScrollZ modifications such as
      additional functions, status variables and all SETs (I really hope
      someone is gonna take over the docs project as I simply don't have
      time to do both the coding and the docs)
      WARNING: SHELP is gone, use HELP from now on!
    + REPWORD is now taken in consideration on actions, we use COLOR ME
      color number 6 for this (requested by skuum)
    + NICKCHAN to display nick change in all user's channels (only once per
      window though, much like SHOWSIGN for signoffs, requested by fox)
    + AWAYENCR to toggle encryption of ScrollZ.away on or off (the file is
      encrypted using master password, a tool to decrypt such encrypted
      files can be found in tools directory)
    + hopefully made scandir() stuff work on all platforms by moving the
      #ifdef magic to scandir.h
    ! ircII NICK bug where entering existing nick twice resulted in client
      believing it gained the nick (reported by dethnite and braneded)
    ! don't select G0 character set null mapping so Putty works with ISO
      8859-1 characters (reported by gamo)
    ! OV now handles whois on opers on ircd 2.10.3 (reported by KOBAN)

    ! topic in status bar bug where topic for current window's channel

    + notify now supports grouping of people, see help for more information
      (requested by KOBAN)
    + possibility to have one OperVision window for several servers

    + scrollz irc.server.com now connects you directly to the specified
      IRC server (patch by braneded)
    + we now finally have a homepage, the URL is www.scrollz.com,

      by braneded)
    ! don't report nicks multiple times in WALL when included with +nick
      (reported by Matt Mills)
    ! crash in RECONNECT/SERVER when IRCHOST was set to an invalid IP

      number of ciphers (suggested by Cnf--)
    ! hopefully ANSI characters in input prompt now work fine in all
      terminal emulators
    ! ircII bug (crash) when splitting lines without spaces (reported by TrN)
    ! ircII bug with meta keys 6,7 and 8 being sticky (reported by nms)
    ! RECONNECT not working for IPv6 connections
    ! bantype E now creates good masks for IPv6 connections (reported by

      hint, reported by gamo)
    ! crypto support for notices now works the same as for messages

ScrollZ v1.8m, 15.10.2001

    ~ AUTORECON crash (reported by Tero)
    - debian subdirectory
    ~ default compile time flags in defs.h.in
    + man page (contributed by Debian maintainer Mike Markley)
    ~ distclean now removes auto generated header files

      requested by entropy)
    + WINDOW SIZE (requested by MadHack)
    ~ changed .ircquick to .scrollzquick
    + permanent ignores (the ones set with IGNORE command) are now saved
      to ScrollZ.save (requested by ogre)
    ! channel settings not being set upon join from .scrollzrc (thanks
      to gamo for figuring this out)
    + define for alphabetically sorted nicks in CSCAN to defs.h
    - AUTORECON since it is handled by a SET
    + anonymous channel topic handling on hybrid7 (reported by braneded)
    + numeric 308 (server admin) on hybrid7 (patch submitted by braneded)
    ! -DCELECOSM without -DCELE compile (reported by braneded)
    ! numeric 477 for IRCNet
    + numeric 276 (virtual channels) on hybrid7 (request by braneded)
    + INSTALL.ScrollZ in doc subdirectory (hello Exodus)
    ! handle ! channels on ircd 2.10 properly, not the ircII way
      (reported by Ahnberg)
    ~ tabkey handler, when line starts with /MSG we adhere to the pre 1.8l
      tabeky behaviour (line is cleared when tab is pressed and next nick
      from the list is inserted, requested by several users)
    + re-added ^T bind so one can use it to insert nicks when line starts
      with /MSG (see above)
    ! status bar bug where string was cut one column too early (reported
      by jaska)
    + CHPASS filter - now removes user's password (suggested by braneded)

      accept -O in case scripts use it. MHOP only sends +h for non opped
      users. MASSV only sends +v for non halfopped / opped users. they're
      also more specific when nobody's to be affected. i.e. MOP -O said
      "no users to op on #channel". now says "no friends to op on #channel"
      (coded by braneded)
    + MC sends -a on hybrid7 servers (coded by braneded)
    + halfops stuff in CHANST and improved look (coded by braneded)
    ~ index is now a section in ScrollZ.help (idea by braneded)

      we can do another LINKS et al. as soon as we like (coded by braneded)
    - Cdcc handling via messages
    + timestamp to DCC chat (requested by ogre)
    + TOPICLOCK and TOPICUNLOCK to lock/unlock topic (requested by acidflash)

    ! hash function to work with high ASCII nicks (used on Russian servers,
      reported by Koban)
    - orignick based on notify signoff
    + ORIGNICK now allows multiple nicks (separate them with comma, requested
      by fox)
    ~ annoying PONG notice when connecting through psyBNC (thanks to markalso
      for debugging) but other things might not work 100% because psyBNC mucks
      with the data stream between client and server
    ! don't crash doing MAP if no LINKS info is returned by ircd (reported
      by braneded)
    + customizable timestamp format (SET STAMP_FORMAT to see default example,

    ! crash when kicked from a channel during TBAN (reported by ogre)
    ~ MODELOCK w/o args now shows stored mode locks for all channels
      (requested by ogre)
    ~ MODELOCK info is no longer lost when we part channel, I wonder how no
      one reported this for the past 2 years
    ! status %! and %y ate one character when invalid args were supplied
    ! status bar and input prompt now honour the value of SET DISPLAY_ANSI
      (found out by ogre)
    + people with Cdcc flag in userlist are exempt from queue and minspeed
      checking (requested by Blaxthos)
    ! display all settings properly not just ORIGNICK
    ! close slow DCC if file transfer does not meet minimum speed (stale
      connections or when user disconnects but client does not notice it)
    + CTCP yournick CDCC QUEUE will tell user their queue position
      (requested by Blaxthos)
    + LLOOK can now store and load information from a file (requested by
      Ahnberg, see help for more information)
    ~ new and improved tabkey handling, if input line starts with /msg nick
      client cycles through msg list otherwise it cycles through nicks
      matching word to the left of the cursor, this can be used to complete
      one channel too (idea by Ahnberg and fox) - this means tabkey in the
      middle of input line is now possible
    - NICK_COMPLETION is gone because of the above
    ~ ^T is back to TRANSPOSE_CHARACTERS
    ! DIRLSM now sends encrypted message to a user if encrypted communication

      Ahnberg and fox)
    + quarantined nicks, full I: line and X: line warning parsing to OV
      (requested by ogre)
    ! crash in input line history search (ircII bug)
    + TIME option to LASTLOG (example: LASTLOG -TIME 19:00-20:00 would only
      print lastlog entries between 19:00 and 20:00), it works only with

      formatted the display (reported by Ahnberg)
    + WHO -SHOW_SERVER to show server in WHO (requested by Tero and others)
    ! prevented excess floods upon CTCP CDCC LIST with huge offers (reported
      by Myrlin)
    ! whois queue handling with servers that in some cases return only
      numeric 401 but not numeric 318 (thanks to markalso for helping me
      with this one)
    ~ STAMP to show time stamp for a lot more events, read help for more
      information (rule of thumb: time stamp is displayed where SCROLLZ_STRING
      would be displayed in older releases when STAMP is set to MAX)
    + new argument NOMODES in OV to supress sending user modes to server when
      OperVision is enabled/disabled (see help for more information, requested
      by crystlize)
    + SET AUTO_RECONNECT to enable/disable automatic reconnect, SET is used so
      it can be set prior to connect in ~/.scrollzrc (aparently some servers
      K: line you for doing this, requested by Jakes)
    ~ LASTJOINER_KICK will only kick target user from channel they joined
      (requested by ogre)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ScrollZ v1.8j, 15.8.2000

Note that the below log is in some cases inconsistent because it was
written accross the v1.8i# (#=1-6) series. Hopefully from now on I'll
be releasing new version in shorter intervals. Also new web page is
in works and will be announced when it will be ready! The changelog
for versions pre 1.8j has been deleted and will be available on the
web page.

    ! Cdcc min speed bug (reported by EA)
    + flags are now used in ScrollZ.save for userlist and shitlist entries
      instead of cryptic numbers
    ! auto nick completion bug
    ! CDCC LOAD now updates number of offered packages
    + added MKILL (in -DACID) by acidflash (DEFKILL is default reason, it is
      saved in ScrollZ.save)
    ! core dump on WHOIS in some cases when country was defined
      (reported by PreZ)
    ! userlist/shitlist bug related to whowas buffer
    ! keyboard handling when prompting for key (URL, SETAWAY,...)

      (requested by JMnemonic)
    ! STATS K core dumping on FEFnet
    ! nasty ircII bug that sometimes led to crash on window kill
      (thanks to c9c1 for help and hints)

    + encryption for userlist passwords (if you use this feature ask
      for utility that will update ScrollZ.save, requested by cain)
    ~ changed encryption for ScrollZ.save, if you use this feature ask for
      new decode utility
    ~ URL catcher now ignores dupes (requested by arc)
    ~ client will now start DCC send from queue when CDCC LIMIT is increased
      (requested by arc)
    ! reconnect on kill, should now work with multiple windows connected
      to different server
    + $8 to DCC_LIST hook, it stands for filesize (requested by nas)
    ~ INSERT_TABKEY to INSERT_TABKEY_NEXT
    + INSERT_TABKEY_PREV (default bind is alt-i, requested by Myrdraal)
    + DCC, Cdcc, tabkey and auto-reply are now multiple servers compliant
      (requested by several users)
    + SET DCC_PORTS, usage is /set dcc_ports low_port-high_port, this
      tells client to only use ports from range low-port-high_port for DCC
      connections (this is useful for people who are behind a firewall so
      they can open only a limited number of ports), when set to 0 it has
      no effect (requested by someone whose nick I forgot, if you are
      reading this please remind me to put your name here). Note that this
      is only used for DCC CHAT and DCC SEND.
    + CHSIGNOFF to -DEXTRAS, when set to on it will display list of channels
      when user quit IRC (requested by Merlin)
    + STAMP, when enabled client will show time in front of publics
      (requested by acidflash)

      CDCC NOTICE instead of CDCC PLIST for that channel (requested by Zig)
    ! when DCC chat is established nick is added to tabkey list (reported
      by ogre)
    ! JOIN 1,2,3 now joins #1, #2 and #3 (reported by Merlin)
    ! odd bug on join where channel would be suddenly bound to completely

      list and whowas buffer for channels
    ! crash when user sent large ammounts of files (reported by arc)
    ! shitlist bug with ident being 10 characters long
    ! CHSIGNOFF always showing regardless of setting (reported by kali)

    + WALL now accepts optional target channel as first argument (requested
      by Zero)
    ! status bar not showing usermode +z when set
    ~ DCC ACTIONs now go to window with level DCC or to window whose query nick
      matches DCC nick (reported by Myrdraal)
    ~ orignick will not react on notify signoff if your userhost matches
      userhost of person that signed off, but you have to be on
      a channel for this to work (requested by arc)
    ! wallops not displaying nick when OperVision was active (reported
      by pier)
    ! input prompt bugs shown with ANSI prompts (reported by [Una])

      compliant

      from user (requested by Zig)
    + COLOR SBAR2
    + new status modifier %y#, # is digit or letter in range a-c,
      digits 1-6 represent color1 through color6 from COLOR SBAR
      whereas digits 7-9 and letters a-c represent color1 through
      color6 from COLOR SBAR2 - take a look at default status bar
      variables to see use of this then try COLOR SBAR BLACKBG to
      see it at work (idea and coding by Zakath)
    ! crash when there were no servers in server list (there were
      two related bugs, one on my part and the other is from stock
      client - this is system dependant, reported by Myrdraal)
    ! bitch mode bug (reported by ogre)
    + ability to complete first matching channel name on ^T and
      TAB (try /M #first_few_letters_of_channel<TAB> or

    + Cdcc hooks now also work on CTCP your_nick CDCC LIST
    + FTRACE to -DACID
    + NWHOIS now accepts filter (requested by TrN)

    ! stock client logging bug for good (reported by justme_)
    + merged ircII 4.4F code

    ! channel loss bug when user joined maximum number of channels
      (reported by ogre)

       old style matching use *word* (requested by arc)
    ! closing DCCs with spaces in filenames (reported by arc)
    ! bug where client got all confused when user supplied illegal
      nick to NICK (reported by dds)
    ! bug with auto nick change routine when nick was 9 characters long

      support is being worked on)

    + cele.sz script
    + COLOR CELE

      length of the channel shown in publics. For example:
      *** Wizner (w@blah.somehost.com) has joined channel #reallylongchannel
      <Wizner:#real> hi
      *** Value of TRUNCATE_PUBLIC_CHANNEL set to OFF
      <Wizner:#reallylongchannel> hi
    + QUICKSTAT command, which uses STATUS_FORMAT3. Default bind is F6.
      This should be considered work in progress.

      moved to general client, it is ON for Celerity and OFF otherwise)
    ~ updated cosmetics
